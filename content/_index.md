        content: Working with DSO was a great experience because it allowed us to get
          fresh perspectives on the work we are doing and reminded us what we
          could and should focus on most.
      - content: DSO provides a rare and valuable opportunity for both non-for-profit
          agencies and university students to work together to increase the
          impact the agencies have on society. On behalf of the children we
          serve through A Touch of Understanding, we are grateful for the
          product we received outlining possible expansion models to help us
          reach more students with our disability-awareness programs, fostering
          the development social emotional intelligence, by building empathy and
          igniting respect for all individuals.

        content: We have had the opportunity to work intensively with Development
          Solutions Organization on a comprehensive marketing plan utilizing
          cutting edge ecommerce, social marketing, and SEO techniques, as well
          as optimizing our offline distribution, social media, and fundraising
          strategies. We never imagined it would be possible for us as a
          nonprofit to have access to the same high level of business consulting
          that big corporations benefit from. Our engagement with DSO has truly
          transformed our business and we expect to be able to hire many more
          survivors as a result.

        content: Working with DSO was a great pleasure and ultimately beneficial to the
          growth of our organization. Early on in the consulting engagement, DSO
          took time to get a deep understanding of operations and impact and
          provided an assessment of our value proposition and recommendations
          for improvement. From there, we worked together on an internal
          communications plan and talking points for volunteers to clearly
          communicate with the general public while representing the
          organization. As a result of the DSOâ€™s recommendations, we increased
          traffic to our website and improved our ability to generate awareness
          and interest in our local community. All of this serves to enhance
          support of our development activities on the ground.
