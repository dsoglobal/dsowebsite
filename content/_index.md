        content: Working with DSO was a great experience because it allowed us to get
          fresh perspectives on the work we are doing and reminded us what we
          could and should focus on most.
      - content: DSO provides a rare and valuable opportunity for both non-for-profit
          agencies and university students to work together to increase the
          impact the agencies have on society. On behalf of the children we
          serve through A Touch of Understanding, we are grateful for the
          product we received outlining possible expansion models to help us
          reach more students with our disability-awareness programs, fostering
          the development social emotional intelligence, by building empathy and
          igniting respect for all individuals.
