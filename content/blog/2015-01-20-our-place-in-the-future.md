  I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot lately about where we are in time. We live in a world where communication is not a journey – here even though I have moved thousands of miles from my home in California, I can speak to my mother, and I can see her face on a computer screen. That&#8217;s incredible. We live in the future.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>Growing up in silicon valley, technology has been so ubiquitous that I never really noticed it. Of course there&#8217;s an app for that. Graphics quality, processing speed, communications applications all gained momentum throughout my childhood, buzzing in the background at school and home. I don&#8217;t remember getting my first laptop of my own, or my first cell phone. I don&#8217;t remember switching to cordless phones, to mp3s, to digital streaming. And yet, without my noticing, the world catapulted forward.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>It&#8217;s actually a semester with DSO that began to open my eyes to the possibilities of our time. Before DSO I had used personal cloud storage. I had used Facebook and Twitter to communicate socially with my friends. I had used Skype to talk to my sister when we were in different cities. For all my experience, I had never delved into the potential of the internet for collaboration; accessing a drive as a team, organizing meetings in a digital workspace and connecting our online presence to face-to-face interactions is mind blowing.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>Collaboration is the name of the internet game. Just a few years ago, to suggest that a team, separated by miles, look at a document together, drafting and seeing those edits real time? Ludicrous! Pipe dream! Future mumbo-jumbo.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>I can&#8217;t help but be reminded of the excitement I experienced as a child watching the <em style="">Back to the Future</em> series. <em style="">A hoverboard?!</em> I remember exclaiming to my mother, <em style="">We&#8217;ll know we&#8217;re in the future when we have hoverboards!</em> Alas, while I lack a hover device, I would much prefer a future in which work I do in my Georgetown dorm can instantly contribute to a project in India. Luckily for everyone, that future is now!<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>The question remains: how to give every person access to the possibilities of our time?</p>
