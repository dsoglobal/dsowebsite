   ### **Learning Questions to Consider**

   **Creating processes for progress:**

   * How can you develop a safe space for listening, learning, and empathy?
   * How can you improve processes, practices, and address biases at work?
   * Can you improve the diversity of your teams, leadership, and partners?

   **Taking sustainable and meaningful action:**

   * What is resonating with you as a way to respond and act?
   * What could real, lasting change be and feel like?
   * How can you support efforts towards racial equity, small business revitalization, police/criminal justice reform, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), inclusive economic development, and equity in education?

   **Supporting others accelerate impact:**

   * How can you support those who exemplify anti-racism and inclusion and explicitly not support those who don’t?
   * Can you identify and support partners working to create educational opportunities, empower black communities, and combat racism?
