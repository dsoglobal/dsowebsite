  I had the lucky pleasure of living in a cozy, beautiful vacation home in beautiful <br />Santa Cruz, thanks to the DSO SF team retreat. And now sitting in <br />my dorm room waiting for a new week, I am happy, relaxed and recharged. Happy <br />for reconnecting with this amazing group of people, relaxed because that’s why <br />beaches exist (!) and recharged after intimate and inspiring conversations.

  Arriving at Santa Cruz in the afternoon, we began the retreat with icebreakers <br />and home made quesadillas, thanks to our very own Crystal, one of the SF ELs. <br />Appetites satiated, we broke out into teams to talk about our experiences during <br />the year, both in client teams and DSO as a whole. A little later, the whole team <br />reconvened to have a joint brainstorm session on how to make DSO even better in <br />the coming year(s). We reflected on the many layers of impact that DSO facilitates <br />on our clients, students, ELs, the internal team and the international development <br />ecosystem at large and how we can amplify that impact in the future. I am super <br />stoked about the ideas that come out of that session and look forward to translating <br />those ideas into action in the coming year. </p>

    Our productivity definitely called for a reward and what better reward than food. <br />We drove down to downtown Capitola for dinner and then to the beach for a <br />bonfire, s’mores and more DSO. Our conversation that night reminded me, and I <br />am sure everyone, about what motivates each one of us to stay committed to DSO.  </div>

      From wanting to make a difference beyond hosting events on campus to utilizing <br />professional skills in emerging markets, our reasons might be different but we <br />are all united by the deep desire to learn about and contribute to international <br />development.</p> 
      
      <p>
        These desires were reinforced by our Google Hangout with Saurabh and Amy <br />the next morning. I was inspired by their vision for DSO, their insights about <br />international development and also thankful for reinforcing to us, students, to stay <br />true to issues we care about and engage with them deeply during our college years <br />and beyond. We put our reenergized selves (both mentally and gastronomically, <br />thanks to Crystal again!) to good use by breaking out into teams for work sessions, <br />or GSD: Get(ting) Shit Done, as Lauren put it aptly. With work behind us, we headed <br />to the beach for one last time. Lying in the shade with the sea a few feet away, we <br />ate, talked, slept, read, took photos and reflected. And my reflection is as follows:

        I am thankful for the opportunity to get to know the SF team better in a gorgeous <br />sun-kissed setting, have delicious food for every meal and most of all for the time to <br />reignite my passion for international development. Too often, passions get dimmed <br />in the humdrum of psets, midterms and the quotidian routine. I am glad to have <br />been a part of this retreat for it reminded me as to why I’m here and my vision for <br />myself and the world.
