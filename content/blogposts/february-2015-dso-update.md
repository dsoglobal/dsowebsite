The past few months have been exciting for us as we have added a new DSO hub in Los Angeles, that is now four members strong. We are eager to continue to grow our L.A base and work with nonprofits in the area. Over the past three months, our other hubs in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Washington D.C., have been hard at work growing in the number of volunteers and connecting and working alongside even more nonprofits. Since our last updates, we’ve worked on 7 projects with 17 professional and 18 student volunteers.

In this report, we will feature the Pittsburgh Hub’s most recent engagement with Kiva ([www.kiva.org](http://www.kiva.org/)).

**Featured Project**

**[Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/)** is a non-profit organization that seeks to empower individuals through lending to alleviate poverty. Kiva leverages the Internet and a world-wide network of microfinance institutions and U.S. individual lenders to provide zero-interest/low interest microloans in an effort to promote social impact. Our engagement with Kiva is among one of the new projects we were able to take on with your support.

Kiva leverages the Internet and a world-wide network of microfinance institutions and individual lenders to provide zero-interest/low interest microloans to individuals in the U.S. and abroad, in an effort to promote social impact and increase access to capital.

Sonia, Esther, Shubhangam, and Marlen from our Pittsburgh project team aimed to amplify the Kiva’s core message: connecting people around the world to enable positive change in other communities and beyond. We focused on strategy and planning around various initiatives and received great feedback from the Kiva leads.

**A Testimonial from Kiva**

*I was very impressed with the DSO team I worked with. They did a great job at every stage of the engagement in terms of asking the right questions, seeking clarification, and adapting to changing circumstances in order to deliver a relevant and high-quality deliverable. The final result was a thoughtful analysis, which will allow us to make informed decisions and move our program in a direction that further achieves our organizational goals, while improving the program experience for our participants.*
