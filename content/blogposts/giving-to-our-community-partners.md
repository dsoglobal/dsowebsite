Holiday Giving Guide 2020: [bit.ly/dsogivingguide](https://bit.ly/dsogivingguide)

It’s a privilege to be able to connect our Partners with donors. In this Holiday Giving Guide, DSO is honored to feature some organizations we currently collaborate with: [BMe](https://bmecommunity.org/), [POISE Foundation](https://www.poisefoundation.org/), [Court Appointed Special Advocates for Children - Alexandria / Arlington](https://www.scanva.org/child-advocacy/alexandriaarlington/), [Ek Tara](https://ektara.org.in/), [OneProsper](https://www.oneprosper.org/), and [Agami](https://agami.in/). Donor contributions are critical to achieving impact and helping organizations be resilient.

What a year it has been. Our inspiring and impactful Partners continue to do and lead crucial and equitable social impact work in and with our communities, including supporting each other through this pandemic, ensuring child welfare, ending racism, advancing high-quality and holistic education, furthering climate solutions, and making law and social justice more community-driven. We’ve learned that doing this critical work successfully during this time has typically involved a persistent sense of urgency, active listening and empathy, relationship building, reimagining, making bold pivots, expanding current programs and services, all while often significantly stretching organizational resources and capacity, and trying to sustain personal wellbeing. 

[GivingTuesday](https://www.givingtuesday.org/) is coming up on December 1st. GivingTuesday is a global generosity movement unleashing the power of people and organizations to transform their communities and the world.

We greatly appreciate your giving and support during and beyond GivingTuesday. 

Wishing you a wonderful and safe holiday season. 

With hopefulness and best wishes,

DSO Team
