 **[Kiva Crowdvet](https://www.crowdvet.org/)**

Crowdvet.org aims to harness the knowledge of the crowd to determine which social enterprises to fund. Early-stage social enterprises are stuck in the "missing middle", too big for microfinance, yet too small for traditional banking. CrowdVet.org, a pilot project under the Direct-to-Social Enterprise program, crowdsources the vetting of these loan applications so that Kiva can provide more early-stage social enterprises with access to 0% interest working capital loans. Make social impact virtually. You can sign up to Crowdvet here: [bit.ly/startcrowdvet](http://bit.ly/startcrowdvet).
