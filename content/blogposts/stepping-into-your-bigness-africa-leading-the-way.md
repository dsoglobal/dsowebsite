<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">
  <span>The way we learn and grow is changing profoundly and I am at the core of that change. </p> 
  
  <p>
    This past July, I had the amazing opportunity to travel to Kenya for a Changemakers Summit.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I first heard the term “Stepping into Your BIGness” from Henry De Sio, Frame Change Leader at Ashoka: Innovators for the Public and former “Chief BIGness Officer” for Obama for America. From his experience, Henry highlighted how we are in an environment where everyone needs to lead, there is no room for smallness, and we need to bring our A game. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In Kenya, I had the chance to experience Changemakers stepping into their BIGness and I believe that this BIGness exists across Africa.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here are five examples with my insights: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <font color="#ff6600"><strong>1. Kibera Girls Soccer Academy (KGSA)</strong></font><br /><strong><em><font color="#ff6600">The media is going to stop portraying Africa as “starving child Africa”</font></em></strong> </div> 
    
    <div>
      <div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-align:left">
        <a> <img src="http://www.dsoglobal.org//uploads/2/4/1/8/24188388/724109.jpg?564" alt="Picture" style="width:564;max-width:100%" /></a> </p> 
        
        <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">
          Kibera Girls Soccer Academy at the 2014 Changemakers Summit in Nairobi
        </div></p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kiberagirlssocceracademy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kibera Girls Soccer Academy</a> is a Changemaker School in a slum that grew from the Kibera Girls Soccer Team. The students have initiated a journalism club and partnered with the journalism company Shedders as a way to share their stories with the community through film, photography, and storytelling.  Soccer is an integral part of the KGSA school system and the team competes at a high level in Kenya and internationally.</p> 
      
      <p>
        A few Kibera students filmed and photographed the Changemaker Summit. They wanted to be a part of capturing innovation and solutions happening across the continent. They stepped into their BIGness.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I have every confidence that KGSA is going to play a key part in transforming how the media portrays Africa. The media needs to move away from starving child Africa portrayal and needs to stop accentuating that. It’s time to spotlight the successes and solutions with empathy (not sympathy) based calls for action.

          </p>
          
          <p>
            ​Fundi (Swahili for maker or artisan) Bots uses robotics training to create and empower a new young generation of problem-solvers, innovators, and changemakers. Through its programs such as hands-on trainings, public access to reach youth outside of the school environment, and robotics camp – <a target="_blank" href="http://fundibots.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundi Bots</a> is breaking down a stereotype: that robotics is for geniuses, nerds, and millionaires. But I believe that Fundi Bots is breaking down another immense stereotype: that this skill can only be acquired in formal education.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When there are gaps, don’t sit around and wait, the Fundi Bots team leveraged this opportunity to maximize impact.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Solomon King, Founder of Fundi Bots, created a robot when he was in fourth grade despite a lack of support and resources (no internet for starters). He stepped into his BIGness when this wasn’t a big concept.

            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">
              I visited the Children’s Garden School, where I met Christine Gatwiri, 20 year old Founder of the 1 bob Initiative. Troubled by the harsh learning environment that students in disadvantaged schools encounter, Christine gathered up the 1 shilling coins in her piggy bank to start 1 bob. Through the initiative, Christine is supporting several schools that have a very low pupil to book ratio through “books for schools” and “a candidate’s wish” projects. Hand in hand with this, she has started budget, savings and “Y-Investors” clubs for youth.</p> 
              
              <p>
                During my visit, I experienced the core of Christine’s model: mentorship. On a regular basis, Christine invites her friends from different backgrounds and experiences to mentor girls and boys.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Christine stepped into her BIGness and inspires that in others through one to one and group mentorship.

                  <p>
                    I went to <a href="http://www.lewa.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lewa Wildlife Conservancy</a> (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) with some of my teammates. I was lost for words. The beautiful vastness of the conservancy reminded me to live simply and to do good to preserve our environment.

                    Lewa is home to some of the continent&#8217;s most endangered species – the black rhino and the Grevy’s zebra. Lewa is also one of several conservancies in Kenya that is community owned and governed by a Council of Elders from the communities. Ashoka Fellow Ian Craig is the Executive Director.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Today, Lewa supports 19 schools, 10 water projects, four clinics, a women&#8217;s micro-credit programme and many other community projects. I also learned that a top dream profession for students in surrounding schools is to become a park ranger!
