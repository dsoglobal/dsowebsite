  <a href="http://www.cameroonfdp.com/" title="">CFDP</a> is a non-profit organization aiming to provide health and social education to children in under-developed regions of Cameroon. It empowers youth through a soccer program which also encompasses leadership training, and educational programs. I am particularly inspired by how CFDP integrated soccer into helping children to develop necessary life skills. Soccer, as a sport, is very trans-cultural and beloved by people all around the world. It helps to connect more closely with children living so far away. Working with CFDP, I was responsible for search engine optimization research, to help CFDP become more visible in online communities. Currently I am working on the user experience research to improve its website. I have learnt a lot during my work with CFDP. The skills to conduct SEO research, and applications of user experience research techniques. Most importantly, I improved my communication skills, both with teammates and client. I learnt to cooperate with teammates, and to listen to the needs of clients. </p>
