As part of DSO’s ongoing effort to evolve our online presence and presentation, the internal team decided it was time to update our logo. 

Our original logo had served us well as we grew from inception into an organization that affected true change and positive impact. It conveyed a sense of the natural elements and international reach; as a non profit consultancy in international development, these characteristics served us well. Here it is – the beginnings of the DSO brand:

As part of our evolution, we aimed to move toward a design that conveyed the following characteristics of our organization: 
  
Professional

Trustworthy 

Proficient 

Friendly

International

**The options** 
    
With this aspiration, we brainstormed numerous concepts. We played with typography, size, color, and placement. Here were some of the front-runners:
