**Why I joined DSO:** It is easy to lose sight of personal goals and passions when immersed in the busy- and often times stressful- environment of college. DSO allows me to gain useful skills and knowledge in the business world while allowing me to stay true to myself and my goals of serving a great cause.

**Projects:**

[Costa Rica Humanitarian Foundation](http://www.crhf.org/)

**Aspiration(s):** To live my life in a way that inspires others to do good things, serve others, and make an impact.

**Ask me about/Iâ€™m passionate about:** I enjoy thinking outside of the box, and tackling issues with creativity and innovation. I am passionate about integrating service work into my academic career and not losing sight of my commitment to make the world a better place.
