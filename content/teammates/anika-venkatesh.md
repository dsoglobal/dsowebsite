**Why I joined DSO:** I want to take my summer experience in social impact in Bosnia forward. I am excited for the opportunity to get a bigger picture on sustainable solutions to development challenges, to synthesize private sector best practices that can be applied and be able to analyze the common hurdles that many organizations may share across contexts.

**Projects:** 

**Aspiration(s):** I hope to dive deeper into public-private-civic sector partnerships in development, the role that data can play in development and to understand optimization and strategy for in development better!
