**Why I joined DSO:** I originally joined DSO because it seemed to be the perfect intersection between business and international development, however after spending some time working on projects, I realized it is so much more than that. DSO really has become the perfect place for me to pursue my interests while also working towards making a positive impact around the world.

**Projects:** [Ek Tara](https://ektara.org.in/)

**Aspiration(s):** To do work that fulfills me and makes a greater impact!

**Ask me about/Iâ€™m passionate about:** dogs, anything related to travel, and whatever else you'd like!
