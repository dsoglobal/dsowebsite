**Why I joined DSO:**<!--StartFragment-->

I originally joined DSO because it seemed to be the perfect intersection between business and international development, however after spending some time working on projects, I realized it is so much more than that. DSO really has become the perfect place for me to pursue my interests while also working towards making a positive impact around the world.
