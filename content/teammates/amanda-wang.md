**Why I joined DSO:** I eventually want to start my own nonprofit, and have always been really interested in the critical thinking skills required for consulting -- DSO seems like the perfect way to fuse the two!

**Projects:**

[Costa Rican Humanitarian Foundation](http://www.crhf.org/)

**Aspiration(s):**

Positively affect those around me
