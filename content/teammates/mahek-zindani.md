**Why I joined DSO:** My family has always entailed the concept of service in our lifestyle. When I stumbled upon DSO, I thought this would be the perfect outlet to share my interests for learning, volunteering, and working for the betterment of society with others.

**Projects:**

[Kiva Crowdvet](https://www.crowdvet.org/)

**Aspiration(s):**

In the future, I hope to run my own non-profit, and wherever life takes me, I would like to use my education to make this world a better place, as cheesy as that may sound.
