**Why I joined DSO:** 

<!--StartFragment-->

The DSO community acts as a gestalt; driving a train of innovation, collective thoughts and positive pressure for excellence. These are all elements I value and would be honored to join the ride for. Working with international organizations with likeminded people to evoke and celebrate positive social change is one of the things I’m looking forward to. Social change is the reason why I left Tunisia and came to America; to hopefully one day uplift my country from the ashes of Arab Spring and I believe my first step towards that bridge is DSO.

**Aspiration(s):** 

<!--StartFragment-->

Gandhi once said that life itself is an aspiration; my aspiration would be to walk this life being the very best version of myself, bringing a smile to people’s faces, positively impacting communities and leaving a legacy behind me for next generations to learn from.

**Ask me about/I’m passionate about:** 

<!--StartFragment-->

My passion has no limits; it goes from swimming, sailing, to playing video games and working out. Ultimately, my passion is just to seek discomfort;  boldly saying yes to immerse myself in adventures to face my demons and break my comfort zone.
