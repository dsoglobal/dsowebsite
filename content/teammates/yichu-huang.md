**Why I joined DSO:** I joined DSO because I love meeting new people and learning more about different issues and industries. COVID-19 has made me realize the importance of giving back to the community, so I really hope to apply my existing skills to make real social impact during my time with DSO. 

**Projects:** TBD

**Aspiration(s):** I would like to learn more about the DC community and gain consulting experience.
