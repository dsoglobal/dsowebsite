**Why I joined DSO:** To utilize my design and user research skills to help promote the work of non-profit organizations.

**Projects:**

[Access Afya](https://www.accessafya.com/)

[Case Competition with DSO](https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/enable-volunteer-consultants-tackle-global-issues/reports/?subid=127473)

[Rescuing Leftover Cuisine (RLC)](https://www.rescuingleftovercuisine.org/)

**Aspiration(s):**

To listen, to help, to continually learn. I also have the goal of eventually teaching design in some capacity.
