**Why I joined DSO:** In the academic setting, I have learned a lot about solutions to international development problems, but it's rare that I actually have the opportunity to apply my learnings to the real world. I am excited to join DSO because I want to create with impact with my learnings, develop skills that can allow me to be a better professional and human in general, as well as create lasting meaningful connections with others during this increasingly virtual time.

**Projects:** 

**Aspiration(s):** I would like to gain experience in User Experience/Design as well as develop skills in financial analysis. And in general, I want to learn more about the most prominent issues in development that client organizations are looking to address.
