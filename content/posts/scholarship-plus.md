a scholarship recipient for four years.

**Testimonial:**

> “Scholarship Plus worked with DSO over a 5 month period. They designed a new website, created a marketing plan and fundraising strategy. I was very impressed by their professionalism, research ability and productivity. At the end of the process we were given an extensive plan on how to raise "brand awareness" and how to best target potential donors. We also now have a beautiful and contemporary website that DSO thoughtfully designed.  We are beyond excited to put their plans into action. Working with DSO has been such a gift to or small nonprofit, we are incredibly grateful.”
