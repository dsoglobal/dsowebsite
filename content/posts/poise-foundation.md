**Testimonial:**

> “We had been struggling with marketing towards and engagement of younger donors. DSO's unique approach combined student and professional recommendations that were well thought-out and thorough. Their work was invaluable; we had not been able to address this marketing issue with our limited resources and capacity. The team was very professional and we would highly recommend their services.”
