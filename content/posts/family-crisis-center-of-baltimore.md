  A collaborative partnership between Development Solution Organization and the
  Family Crisis Center of Baltimore County to help them plan to develop the
  tools, process, and procedures to better support once of their core services:
  The Crisis Hotline. This project focused on data management for the crisis
  hotline. Primarily the focus would be on assessing and implementing what is
  necessary to move the hotline from a paper based process to a dynamic
  organized tool that ties together services and clients. In addition to staff,
  the system must support 40 volunteers which currently use physical call sheets
  that are mailed or scanned in.
