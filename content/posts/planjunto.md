PlanJunto understands that ecosystems in the global south are under threat despite being important to the planet’s health. The rural, indigenous populations often have close relationships with natural environment but
are economically poor.  PlanJunto works to tie together solutions to both environmental degradation and local
poverty by bringing to bear a team of specialized professionals, with over 30 years of experience in the field to
apply a field tested, results based operational model to implement best practices to issues such as forest
management.


This community enterprise builds linkages with potential allies and investors to create a portfolio of viable
community enterprise projects with expert guidance which lowers investment risk. Some of their projects have
included: fair trade Amazonian tea, community banks, an Andean Mezcal community enterprise, sustainable
timber and Amazonian Solar river transport.

**What We Did:**

Reviewed Best Practices for an inaugural PlanJunto Community Accelerator  Outlined business models and analyzed existing organizations with aligned missions
Reviewed potential revenue models and recommendations for financially sustainable growth
Provided considerations for intellectual property strategy in the Community Accelerator
Highlighted Prioritization and Go-to-Market strategy for PlanJunto

**Testimonial:**

> “I was very happy with the market research and business model analysis that the DSO team provided for PlanJunto. We were supported by a diverse team with broad experience on a range of technical issues that
> we do not have in-house. This allowed us gain access to knowledge and tailored advice that would ordinarily not have been within our reach."
