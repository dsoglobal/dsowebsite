BPSHI strives to eliminate health and social disparities within underserved and underprivileged populations by providing access to health education for the betterment of the mind, body, spirit. The organization is modeled
and inspired by Bhagat Puran Singh whose devotion to humanity and selfless service was the inspiration for
BPSHI to go above and beyond.


BPSHI is currently based out of California.

budget approval time


Developed a database of grants as an alternative
revenue stream

**Testimonial:**

> “DSO helped our organization, and myself personally, understand exactly what our needs were in a tangible concrete way. Sometimes, leading an organization, it's so hard to get caught up with the idea that there's just so much to go and on top of that, an entire vision/brand to grow. DSO helped bring us back to here and now. What can we do with some extra support today. We can't say thank you enough.”
