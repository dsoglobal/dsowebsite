[Future Forward: Innovations for Youth Employment in Africa](https://www.changemakers.com/futureforward) is supporting a cohort of 25 Fellows (leading social entrepreneurs) and building a global community of Changemakers who are shifting the conversation from recognizing the problem to one about creating solutions ([such as 24 year old Madelle's Jumpstart Academy Africa](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2015/02/05/how-innovative-young-africans-are-fixing-a-broken-education-system/). Madelle is cultivating an entrepreneurship curriculum and mentorship in schools in Cameroon) that engage Africa's youth in strengthening sense of purpose and[create new fields of meaningful employment](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2014/04/16/the-9-best-jobs-in-africa-dont-exist-yet/) to improve livelihoods.

**What We Did:**

Created seven Fellows’ profiles using the Changemakers platform to clearly convey Fellow story, work and impact

More intentionally linked Fellows’ work in Future Forward’s social media channels

Developed engagement strategies targeting organizations, journalists and bloggers

Created an infographic to convey one Fellow’s solution in the bigger picture of “What’s the next big opportunity for the world’s youngest continent?”

**Testimonial:**

> “Working with DSO was a great experience because it allowed us to get fresh perspectives on the work we are doing and reminded us what we could and should focus on most.”
